# Configuration

[Back To README](README.md)

```
[[inputs.elasticsearch]]
  ## specify a list of one or more Elasticsearch servers
  servers = ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]

  ## Timeout for HTTP requests to the elastic search server(s)
  http_timeout = "5s"

  ## When local is true (the default), the node will read only its own stats.
  ## Set local to false when you want to read the node stats from all nodes
  ## of the cluster. 
  # local = true

  ## Set cluster_health to true when you want to also obtain cluster health stats
  # cluster_health = false

  ## Adjust cluster_health_level when you want to also obtain detailed health stats
  ## The options are
  ##  - indices (default)
  ##  - cluster
  # cluster_health_level = "indices"

  ## Set cluster_stats to true when you want to also obtain cluster stats.
  # cluster_stats = false

  ## Only gather cluster_stats from the master node. To work this require local = true
  # cluster_stats_only_from_master = true

  ## node_stats is a list of sub-stats that you want to have gathered. Valid options
  ## are "indices", "os", "process", "jvm", "thread_pool", "fs", "transport", "http",
  ## "breaker". Per default, all stats are gathered.
  # node_stats = ["jvm", "http"]

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
